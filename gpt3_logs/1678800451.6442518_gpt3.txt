DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The GPT3 error occurs when the 'charmap' codec is unable to encode a character in a specific position. In this case, the character is '\u2002' and it is in position 3038. The character maps to <undefined> in the 'charmap' codec, which causes the error. This error can occur in other positions as well, such as 1876, 1134, 145, 711, 1602, 2107, 2918, 1990, and 647. In each case, the character is '\u2002' and it maps to <undefined> in the 'charmap' codec. This causes the GPT3 error to occur.
